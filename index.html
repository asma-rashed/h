            <h3 class="centerText">The culture of Saudi Arabia is a rich one that has been shaped by its Islamic
                heritage,
                its historical role as
                an ancient trade center, and its Bedouin traditions.
                Saudi society has experienced tremendous development over the past several decades. The Saudi people
                have
                taken
                their values and traditions – their customs, hospitality and even their style of dress – and adapted
                them to
                the
                modern world.</h3>
            <h3><b>Arab and Islamic Traditions</b> <br>
                Saudi traditions are rooted in Islamic teachings and Arab customs, which Saudis learn about at an early
                age
                from
                their families and in schools.
                The highlights of the year are the holy month of Ramadan and the Hajj (pilgrimage) season, and the
                national
                holidays that follow them. The holy month of Ramadan, during which Muslims fast from dawn to dusk,
                culminates
                with the Eid-Al-Fitr holiday, in which it is customary to buy presents and clothes for children and
                visit
                friends and relatives.
                The other highlight is the Hajj season, during which millions of Muslim pilgrims from around the world
                come
                to
                Makkah. The Hajj season concludes with the Eid Al-Adha holiday, in which it is traditional for families
                to
                slaughter a sheep in memory of Abraham’s willingness to sacrifice his son.
                Arab traditions also play an important role in Saudi life. These age-old traditions have evolved over
                the
                millennia and are highly regarded. They include generosity and hospitality, which every Saudi family
                offers
                to
                strangers, friends, and family. The simplest expression of hospitality is coffee – its preparation alone
                is
                an
                intricate cultural tradition, and it is often served in small cups along with dates and sweets. Another
                gesture
                of hospitality is the burning of incense (oud) to welcome guests.</h3>
