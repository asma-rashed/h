                Saudi ardah<br>
                Najdi ardah is the most common variant of ardah in Saudi Arabia. It is also the most practiced and
                highly televised male folkloric dance in the entire country. The Saudi government changed its name to
                'Saudi ardah' in the 21st century. However, there are numerous variations of ardah distinct from Najdi
                ardah throughout the country, notably in the regions of Najran, Asir and Jizan.<br>
